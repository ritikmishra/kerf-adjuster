# kerf-adjust

This is going to be a web application where you can upload a DXF into your web browser and offset contours
in order to adjust for the kerf of your laser.


The UI elements are made using React and TypeScript. The DXF manipulation logic is written using Rust and compiled
to WebAssembly so that it can run in the browser.
